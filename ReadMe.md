## Foreword

The [C2PA Font Handler/Codec library](./c2pa-font-handler/ReadMe.md) is intended to be used with
[c2pa-rs](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs). It should NOT be considered
a full-featured font software reader/writer. It is intended to do the minimum
for handling the Content Credential for font software.

## Features

Currently OpenType/TrueType font software is supported by default. Support for WOFF is still in progress and can be tested out by enabling the `woff` feature.

## License

This library is released under the [Apache License Version 2.0](./LICENSE).
